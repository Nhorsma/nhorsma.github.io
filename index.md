## Welcome to my Portfolio!

I am a graduate of Kennesaw State University with a bachelors in Computer Game Design and Development. I have a passion for making video games and exploring how games engage their players and create a fun experience.

This page contains some of my most notable game projects I have worked on in my time at Kennesaw and during my professional career. If any of these peak your interest, feel free to contact me at [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Nhorsma/nhorsma.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Nhorsma/nhorsma.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
