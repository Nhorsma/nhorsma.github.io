## Who am I?

I am a graduate of Kennesaw State University with a bachelors in Computer Game Design and Development and a minor in Computer Science. I have a passion for making video games and exploring how games engage their players and create a fun experience. My primary experience in game design is in Unity, I also have experience in 3D modeling in Maya and Blender and UI design for applications.

Below are some of my more notable video game and 3D modeling projects I have worked on in my time at Kennesaw and during my professional career. If any of these peak your interest, feel free to contact me at **nichorsma@gmail.com**.

## My Games



### Dead Engines

_Dead Engines_ is my senior capstone project, this build is the demo with the rest of the game to be completed by the end of 2021. _Dead Engines_ is a post-apocolyptic strategy game where the player controls a group of settlers who have taken shelter inside of a massive, ancient robot. The player must assign the settlers to collect resources, combat enemy raiders, and re-build the inside of the robot to re-activate it.

The game is divided into two phases, the first phase the player must control individual units to collect metal and electronics to build upgrades and repair the robot. The second phase starts when the robot is reactivated and is controlled by the player. You can select individual units or box select them and assign them to move, collect resources, or fight enemies. When the robot awakens, the player can take control of the robot and fight bigger enemies. Left click on the robot to manage resources and build rooms that give bonuses to units and the robot.

_Dead Engines_ was made with Sarah Miller, see her work at [smillerworks.github.io/porto](https://smillerworks.github.io/porto/).

### Mr. Sushi

_Mr. Sushi_ is a casual game about fullfilling sushi orders from a conveyor belt. Pack and organize sushi coming down the belt into the black trays below based on the instructions above the belt, but be fast or else you'll fall behind.

_Ten Gallon Tussle_ is a top-down shooter where the player must escape a bar full of dastardly desparadoes by reaching the the door across the room. Movement is with WASD, use your mouse to aim and left-click to shoot.

_Ten Gallon Tussle_ was made with Chase Randalow, contact him at **chase.randalow@gmail.com**.



## 3D Modeling
I also have experience with 3D modeling in Maya, I have made most of the models for the game _Dead Engines_ myself as well as the models for another class project called _Schwer_.

### Schwer Models

These are some of the models I produced for the project _Schwer_, which include the game's NPC's, a Firey Fox emerging from a campfire, and the buildings used in the main level.

### Other Models
These models were made for a 3D modeling class project, each model came with 3 animations and were implimented into gameplay.
