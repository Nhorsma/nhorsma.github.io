## Who am I?

I am a graduate of Kennesaw State University with a bachelors in Computer Game Design and Development and a minor in Computer Science. I have a passion for making video games and exploring how games engage their players and create a fun experience. My primary experience in game design is in Unity, I also have experience in 3D modeling in Maya and Blender and UI design for applications.

Below are some of my most notable game projects I have worked on in my time at Kennesaw and during my professional career. If any of these peak your interest, feel free to contact me at **nichorsma@gmail.com**.

## My Games



### Dead Engines

Download for Windows:

_Dead Engines_ is my senior capstone project, this build is the demo with the rest of the game to be completed by the end of 2021. _Dead Engines_ is a post-apocolyptic strategy game where the player controls a group of settlers who have taken shelter inside of a massive, ancient robot. The player must assign the settlers to collect resources, combat enemy raiders, and re-build the inside of the robot to re-activate it.

The game is divided into two phases, the first phase the player must control individual units to collect metal and electronics to build upgrades and repair the robot. The second phase starts when the robot is reactivated and is controlled by the player. Select individual units or box select them with left click, right click the ground to assign them to move or on resources/enemies to have them extract or attack. When the robot awakens, right click to move the robot and use Q and W to attack. Left click on the robot to manage resources and build rooms, and click '0' to add more resources (for debugging).

_Dead Engines_ was made with Sarah Miller, see her work at [smillerworks.github.io/porto](https://smillerworks.github.io/porto/).

## 3D Modeling
I also have experience with 3D modeling in Maya, I have made most of the models for the game _Dead Engines_ myself as well as the models for another class project called _Schwer_.

### Schwer Models

These are some of the models I produced for the project _Schwer_, which include (from left to right) the game's NPC's, a Firey Fox emerging from a campfire, and the buildings used in the main level.


### Dead Engines Models

These are some of the more notable models I produced for my studio project _Dead Engines_, which includes a massive robot and all it's animations, a marauder encampment, and marauder vehicles.
