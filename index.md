## Welcome to my Portfolio!

I am a graduate of Kennesaw State University with a bachelors in Computer Game Design and Development. I have a passion for making video games and exploring how games engage their players and create a fun experience.

This page contains some of my most notable game projects I have worked on in my time at Kennesaw and during my professional career. If any of these peak your interest, feel free to contact me at **nichorsma@gmail.com**.
